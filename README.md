# Assembler-C-Lab-Project
Input files should be located in the same directory as the assembler.exe file (I included the example run file from the assignment instructions for illustration).
Compilation command: make
Execution command: ./assembler <name file here>
Output files will be generated according to the input file and will be located in the same directory as the input file.
